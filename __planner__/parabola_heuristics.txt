Heuristics for generating parabola
~ means 'around/about'

ballistic motion planning
1. friction cone (both start and land) (mu ~ 0.4 - 1)
2. mininum and maximum velocity constraint (both start and land)
minimum: ~ 1-2 m/s
maximum: ~ 3-4 m/s

others:
1. always land from above (dz_end < 0)
2. collision checking consider the robot as a ball (radius ~ 0.05-0.1 m)
3. lower sampling probability when close to the wall
can start off by offseting from the wall by ~ 0.1-0.2 m depending on the height of the wall

**Bonus features:
1. consider slope surface
terrain is not flat everywhere, then the friction cone is changing orientation
